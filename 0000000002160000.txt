jd; Their lobbyists pushed all this through to screw the rail roads.
The rail roads had built their own tracks, except for that major track, in fact even the one at the beginning of the Civil War.
The rail roads had to put all this track beds in.
And they bought the property, they put the track in, they got the right away from the government sometimes, but they weren't - the government wasn't putting the tracks in.
It was the rail roads because they were competing with each other.
And then, the building is building all these roads for the truckers.
