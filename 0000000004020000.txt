ac; Ha, I mean is there no testing done at all?
Are they just dumping their radioactive material into products and shipping them to us? 
It's like, that's a handy way.
jd; And I now wonder what else there is. 
I mean that's just on item that they caught. 
Who knows, if that can get through, because they supposedly can pick up, you know, those minuscule amounts of radiation. 
And if that can get though,
ac; You know what I'm... Whoa!
jd; the place could be contaminated.
