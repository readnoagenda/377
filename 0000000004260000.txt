If you know, I succeeded Barry Goldwater in the United States Senate, and on election night when I was elected, and Barry got a little nostalgic, and he said, "You know John, if I'd have been elected president in nineteen sixty-four (1964), and beaten Lindon Johnson", he said, "you'd have never spent all those years in a Vietnamese prison camp."
And I said, "You're right, Barry. It would have been a Chinese prison camp."
