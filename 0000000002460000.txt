c; What. I will never forget. is the trust. you. place. in me.
To. be. your voice.
Thank you. for. your. prayers.
And. for giving. me. time to. re-cover.
I. have. more. work. to do. on my recovery.
So. to do. what is. that. is. best. for. Arizona.
I. will. step. down. this. week.
I'm. getting. better.
