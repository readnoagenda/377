ac; And I'll give you a synopsis. The way they laid out the story is of course what is completely true, that they changed all the money, everyone had the Euro, so of course Greece had the same money valued the same way as the Germans had, and so countries like Greece and Portugal and Spain and Italy could go and borrow lots of money at low interest rates  and everybody did and everyone built crazy stuff and they soaked the EU. Now we all agree on that.
