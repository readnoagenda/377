That will never happen.
c1; Why?
c2; He's not going to be the President of the United States.
This is- that's not going to happen.
Let me just make my prediction and stand by it.
That. Isn't. Going to. Happen.
c1; Why are you so sure?
c2; There's something I know.
The Republicans, if they choose to nominate him, that's their prerogative.
And I don't think that's going to happen.
