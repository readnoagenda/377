c1; More real today than is was a week, or a month ago. That he would be the Republican nominee.
And that you could come back here next January, or next February, with a President Gringech.
ac; Heh.
c2; Let me just say this:
-pause-
That will never happen.
c1; Why?
c2; He's never going to be the President of the United States.
This is- that's not going to happen.
Let me just make my prediction and stand by it.
That. Isn't. Going to. Happen.
c1; Why are you so sure?
c2; There's something I know.
The Republicans, if they choose to nominate him, that's their prerogative.
And I don't think that's going to happen.
-music-
ac; Alright.
