ac; There used to be a statue of Maria up there, but I think they kept stealing the statue. 
So, they just put a big 'M' with a little crown on it, which is nice because of course 'M' also stands for Micky. 
And I take her up there.
You know, its like "Hey," under the ruse of, "lets go. Hey, there's one sunset during the this whole week that we're here, let's go take some pictures." 
And I couldn't believe she actually feel for it because- 
And I drove to it one go which I had rehearsed, previously. 
You know, she should have known something was up right then like "Wait a minute, Adam can never find his way on the ground."
