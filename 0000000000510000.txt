ac; the tallest point in Bonaire, where they have a nice little a, there is a, there used to be a statue of Maria up there, but I think she kept, they kept stealing the statue so they just put a big 'M' with a little crown on it, which is nice cause of course 'M' also stands for Micky. And I take her up there, you know its like hey, under the ruse of lets go, hey there's one sunset during the this whole week that we're here, let's go take some pictures and I couldn't believe she actually feel for it cause and I drove to it one go which I had rehearsed previously. You know, she should have known something was up right then like wait a minute, Adam can never find his way on the ground
