jd; force them to sell their oil for gold and, in the process, jack up the price of gold to maybe eighteen hundred dollars (1800 USD), get them loaded up with the stuff, and then pull the plug on the price of gold, sink the price of gold, which will screw them over.
They will end up selling their oil for less than cost, because they'll be stuck with all this gold that's gonna be worth less. I think that would be a much more interesting plan.
