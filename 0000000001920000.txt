jd; It shows a guy and it's supposed to be a hidden camera.
And the guy gets a half a haircut.
And he says "that's your haircut"
"You only cut half of my hair!"
"Ah you don't need it, look at this half, this half is done."
and the he says "I want the other half, I want the other half!"
Then they have the Obama logo at the end.
It means the other half. We've only had half a haircut so far.
ac; I've seen this, you know what actually, I think Miss Micky showed it to me.
She thought it was a really funny video, until I pointed out to her what was really going on.
