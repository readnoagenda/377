ac; So the certificates is a problem because you have to trust the person or the entity, the company, that is issuing the certificate. So the way it works is when you type in like, uh, NoAgendaSuperPAC dot com, it's going to do a lookup on the DNS server, but it's going to do it in a secure fashion. If it doesn't get a proper key, then it will try the next one and the next one and the next one, and it goes down the line until it finally gets a real authoritative DNS server that has the proper key, which is hackable.
