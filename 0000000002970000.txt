ac; This is the latest Rasmussen report, if you believe anything, but they dropped a clue. "The latest Rasmussen reports national telephone surveys find that 33 percent of the voters think it would be good if a new candidate entered the presidential race on the Republican side." There is our magic number 33, which means to me, it's time for Jeb Bush to start polishing the knob. It's time for him to step in. I mean that's just a pure sign right there.
