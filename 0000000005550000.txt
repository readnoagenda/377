ac;I think it was pegged at two (2) guilders to the euro, so you would buy a cucumber for two guilders (2 ANG [???]), and the next day you walked in the store, and it was like two euros (2 EUR).
They just put a euro sign in front of everything.
And everyone knows it.
Everyone knows this is what went on.
It was nuts.
I mean, coffee is like five euros (5 EUR) for a coffee, which is ten guilders (10 ANG).
You tell people, it's like, "I can't believe I'm buying a cup of coffee for ten guilders (10 ANG)".
It's just... it happened here in Bonaire!
It happened at the... last year when they went to the dollar.
Same thing!
