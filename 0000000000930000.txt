jd; written a State of the Union speech and I'm scheduled to give one.

ac; It's interesting cause if you look at whitehouse.gov, I don't have a clip of it, but they did one of those West Wing Week episodes, you know his reality show. It was behind the scenes of the writing of it and they got the speech writers and all his supreme advisors and the president is really involved. And cut to scene of president: "I really want this in there." It's hilarious. It's worse reality television than reality television.
