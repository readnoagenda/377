Uh -- Things weren't cheap there anymore. It was just a whole economy was just switched over to this, like, everything's -- it's like all of a sudden everything in the United States costing thirty per cent (30%) more just overnight for no reason.

ac; Well a lot of countries did that. You know, the Netherlands we saw the same -- I was living there at the time, and when they switched to the Euro from the Guilder and at the time I think it was pegged at two Guilders to the Euro, so you would buy a cucumber
