All true, all the time, all the time, the Manning Report, is sure to blow your mind.
c;Hey citizen.
cjdm;Whoop Obama's behind! 
Whoop him, whoop him, whoop him! 
Whoop him, whoop him, whoop him! 
Whoop him with the constitution! 
He is wholly and totally ineligible! 
He's a criminal! 
Whoop him Ron, whoop him! 
Whoop him and whoop him and whoop him.
