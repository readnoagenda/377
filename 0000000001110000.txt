jd; Well, the comment that he made was that theres more student loans outstanding than credit card debt, I guess.
ac; Right, we know this
jd; That doesn't sound good.
ac; No, we've discussed this and we know this, but I didn't know that the student loan rates are going to double, and by the way, they don't have to double. There is no rule that says they're going to double, they're just not set by law. So, they can easily just pass a law
jd; No, it's an out and out gouge.
