ac; What happened just recently is, just to show how bad the system actually is, I think it's a single point of failure now, um, NASA dot gov, on the day of the SOPA/PIPA explosion, everyone on Comcast could not get to NASA dot gov because someone had misconfigured their key. So therefore, if you were on Comcast, you could not get to NASA dot gov. So it just shows you that the real power is all in ICANN, it's all in the DNS system.
