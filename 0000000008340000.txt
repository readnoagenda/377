ac; I'm looking now because I remember there was an article that I reading and maybe it was a, maybe it was on 'Anger Fan'.  
But they broke it down and they broke it down by what Scotland actually brings into the UK and I was I was blown away.  It was like huge and I, oh man I wish I could find that, let me see.  Uh maybe well something we'll have to, we'll have to discuss on the next show.  But this is definitely homework.
