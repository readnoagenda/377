No, I didn't.
Not to any extent, but I have one basic question.
If these two people are kidnapped and they're being held for, I don't know, a year or some three months.

jd; How do they know her health is failing unless they, you know, how does that work?
ac; They-
jd; Are they sending out press releases? 
Are the pirates sending out a press release, "Oh, her health is failing."

ac; The whole story doesn't make sense.
